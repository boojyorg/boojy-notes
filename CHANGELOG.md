# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features
- **VS Code-style drag & drop** — Tab reordering within the same tab bar via drag insertion line; drag tabs across panes at exact positions; sidebar drag uses compact pill ghost (max 200px) with count badge for multi-drag; 20% edge zones (up from 10%) for split creation; vertical accent-colored insertion line shows exact drop position in any tab bar; Option+drag duplicates a tab to another pane; Escape cancels any drag in progress; sidebar ghost now moves in 2D (follows cursor into editor area)
- **Split view** — Open two notes side by side with `Cmd+Shift+\`; each pane has its own tab bar, editor, floating toolbar, and find bar; draggable divider with double-click-to-reset and snap-to-close; `Cmd+1`/`Cmd+2` to switch active pane (indicated by accent border); `Cmd+Click` on wikilinks opens the linked note in the other pane (creates split if needed); drag tabs between panes or to edge zones to create splits; drag notes from sidebar into editor edge zones to create splits; same note can be open in both panes with shared content but independent scroll/cursor; split state persists across app restarts; closing the last tab in a pane auto-collapses back to single view; supports both vertical and horizontal splits; works in Day and Night themes

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix horizontal split crash** — Horizontal split caused blank screen because `panes.left` was hardcoded in accessors; now dynamically resolves the first pane ID based on split mode (`top`/`bottom` for horizontal, `left`/`right` for vertical)
- **Fix drop-zone overlay covering sidebar** — Tab drag overlay used `.editor-scroll`'s parentElement (the main layout row including sidebar) instead of `.editor-scroll` itself; overlay now correctly bounds to the editor area only
- **Fix performance issues and memory leaks in split view** — Main-level `selectionchange` listener, `useLayoutEffect` for focus/caret, and editor fade-in effects now skip when split mode is active (PaneContainers have their own); `onMenuExport` IPC handler no longer re-registers on every keystroke (uses refs); `setWindowTitle` effect no longer re-runs on every text change (depends on title only); stale-note cleanup in split panes only runs when notes are actually deleted rather than on every `noteData` change; EditorArea tooltip timer now cleans up on unmount to prevent state updates on unmounted components

### Known Issues
- **Split view is buggy** — There are visual and state issues with the split view feature; fixes are planned

## 0.1.1 — 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Sync conflict resolution** — When simultaneous edits are made on different devices, a conflict copy is created (e.g. "Note Title (conflict 2026-03-09 12:00:04)") so no data is ever lost; clickable toast notification appears for 8s; conflict copies listed in Settings > Sync with quick-open buttons
- **Offline sync recovery** — Dirty notes and their content are persisted to localStorage so edits survive app crashes and tab closes while offline; sync resumes automatically on reconnect with online/offline detection
- **Sync status indicators** — Sync dot in TopBar and Settings reflects conflict (yellow), offline (gray), and error (red) states in addition to syncing/synced/idle
- **Hide title bar on web** — The draggable title bar with note name is now only shown in the Electron desktop app

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix sync function routing** — Client was calling a non-existent unified `sync` function; now correctly calls separate `sync-push`, `sync-pull`, `sync-delete` edge functions
- **Fix isRemoteUpdate race condition** — Replaced single boolean flag with a Map of noteId-to-timestamp entries; stale entries auto-cleaned after 5s to prevent blocking dirty detection
- **Remove dead storage_usage subscription** — Removed realtime subscription to non-existent `storage_usage` table; 60s polling fallback already covers missed broadcasts
- **Fix logo images missing in production build** — TopBar and Settings modal images used absolute paths (`/assets/...`) that don't resolve under Electron's `file://` protocol; now imported as ES modules so Vite bundles them correctly
- **Fix memory leaks from drag event listeners** — Block drag, sidebar drag, and table drag-to-create handlers added `pointermove`/`pointerup` listeners to `window` that weren't removed if the component unmounted mid-drag; now stored in refs and cleaned up on unmount

### Features (continued)

- **Table edge-zone interactions** — Replaced the hover toolbar with edge-based interaction zones: click the left edge to select a row, click the top edge to select a column, hold and drag to reorder rows/columns (400ms hold-to-drag with floating clone and insertion line), hover the bottom/right edge for a `+` button to add rows/columns (click for one, drag to create multiple with live preview and counter badge), right-click context menus for insert/delete operations with column alignment controls, keyboard shortcuts (Arrow keys to move selection, Backspace/Delete to remove, Escape to deselect); header row is locked and cannot be dragged or deleted
- **Help button & cheat sheet** — Added a (?) help icon in the top-right corner of the toolbar; clicking it opens a floating quick-reference dropdown with categorized editing syntax, keyboard shortcuts, and feature tips; closes on click-outside or Escape; works in both Day and Night themes

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix DAY theme search input & settings modal** — Search input had hardcoded dark background (`#18191E`), now uses `theme.searchInputBg` (white in DAY mode); settings modal had hardcoded dark background and white-overlay borders that only worked in NIGHT mode, now uses `theme.modalBg`, `theme.modalShadow`, and `theme.overlay()` for all borders/backgrounds so both themes render correctly

### Improvements
- **Smooth theme transition** — Switching between Night and Day themes now crossfades all colors over 400ms instead of switching instantly; implemented via a temporary global CSS transition injected on theme change and removed after completion

### Features
- **Day/Night theme system** — Full light/dark theme support with smooth 400ms crossfade transitions; Day mode uses flat sky-blue backgrounds with warm gold accent; Night mode preserves the existing dark palette with teal accent and star field; toggle between Night, Day, and Auto modes in Settings > Appearance; Auto mode supports both system preference detection and time-of-day scheduling with configurable hours; theme state persisted in localStorage

### Improvements
- **Theme infrastructure** — Created `ThemeProvider` React context with `useTheme()` hook; two complete palettes in `src/constants/themes.js` (NIGHT and DAY) covering all color tokens; migrated all 22 component files from direct `colors.js` imports to `useTheme()` hook; terminal theme, scrollbar styles, inline code/link/wikilink colors, callout backgrounds, and code block styles all respond to theme changes; dev tools overlay includes theme quick-toggle

### Features
- **Blockquote support** — Lines starting with `>` now render as blockquotes with a thin accent-colored left border and italic muted text (Obsidian-style); consecutive `>` lines group into one block; type `> ` to auto-convert, use `/blockquote` slash command, or write `>` lines in markdown; Enter continues the blockquote, Backspace on empty reverts to paragraph; `> [!type]` callouts are unaffected

### Bug Fixes
- **Make code block and callout backgrounds opaque** — Pre-blended semi-transparent backgrounds (`rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` for code blocks, `rgba(...,0.20)` for callouts) against the `#040412` editor background to produce solid hex colors; prevents star field canvas from bleeding through these elements
- **Fix code block keyboard input and language selector** — Code block text and language changes were silently swallowed by `EditorArea`'s `React.memo` comparator, which only checked block `id` and `type` — intentionally skipping `text` for contentEditable blocks but unintentionally blocking textarea-based code blocks too; now the memo also compares `text` and `lang` for code-type blocks so state updates flow through to `CodeBlock`
- **Fix ghost note naming after promotion** — When typing in the body first, `promoteDraft` forced the title to the literal string "Untitled", replacing the faded placeholder with solid text that required manual clearing; now keeps the title empty so the CSS placeholder remains active and the user can type a title naturally; added `|| "Untitled"` fallback to tab labels for display consistency
- **Fix ghost note not appearing in empty vault** — On app start, `activeNote` could point to a deleted note via stale localStorage, preventing the draft-creation effect from firing; now resets `activeNote` to null when it references a non-existent note. Also fixed `onFileDeleted` disk sync wiping in-memory draft notes by preserving `_draft` entries during `setNoteData` overwrites
- **Fix deleted folders/notes retaining stale ordering position** — When a folder or note was deleted, its custom drag-order entry persisted in `sidebarOrder`; re-creating it would cause it to reappear at its old position instead of sorting alphabetically; now `deleteFolder` cleans the folder (and all subfolders) from both `customFolders` and `sidebarOrder`, and `deleteNote` removes the note ID from its folder's `noteOrder`; external deletions via Finder also clean `sidebarOrder` during folder sync
- **Fix orphaned folders remaining in sidebar after vault files deleted** — The `onFileDeleted` handler only merged folders into `customFolders` and never removed stale ones; when all files in a folder were deleted externally, the empty folder persisted in the sidebar; now syncs `customFolders` against actual disk state, removing folders that no longer contain notes
- **Fix progressive slowdown on note switch** — `useHistory` was cloning the entire `noteData` object (all notes) on every edit, accumulating massive memory pressure across 50 undo stack entries; now stores per-note `{ noteId, snapshot }` tuples, reducing memory ~100×. Wrapped all `useEditorHandlers` return values in `useCallback` so `React.memo` on `EditorArea` is no longer bypassed on every parent render. Fixed `visibilitychange` listener leak (anonymous function couldn't be removed in cleanup).

### Improvements
- **Ghost note empty state** — Replaced the static "Notes" logo splash screen with a live editor draft; when no note is open, a phantom note appears with "Untitled" and "Type / for commands..." placeholders; the note materializes into a real note (sidebar, tabs, disk) only when you start typing; navigating away from an empty draft silently discards it
- **Performance: reduce unnecessary re-renders** — Memoized sidebar tree computation (folder hierarchy, filtering, sorting) with `useMemo` chains so it only recomputes when `noteData`, `customFolders`, `sidebarOrder`, or `search` change; wrapped `Sidebar`, `ContextMenu`, and `EditorArea` in `React.memo`; removed unstable `isSelected` callback in favor of `selectedNotes.has()` inline; extracted inline `onNavigateToNote` closure to `useCallback`; memoized `activeFormats` default object to prevent spurious `FloatingToolbar` re-renders

### Features
- **Multi-select notes in sidebar** — Cmd+Click to toggle individual notes, Shift+Click to select a range; right-click shows bulk context menu with "Delete N notes", "Move to..." folder submenu, and "Move to root"; multi-drag moves all selected notes as a group with a count badge; selection clears on plain click, editor click, or search activation

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix nested folders flattened to root level** — Nested folder paths like `University/25-26 Semester 2/COMP208` were saved as flat directories with underscores (`University_25-26 Semester 2_COMP208`) because `sanitizeFilename()` was applied to the entire path; now each path segment is sanitized individually, preserving the nested directory structure; same fix applied to restore-from-trash
- **Fix folder drag-and-drop reordering** — Folder reordering now works correctly at all nesting levels; fixed root-level reorder using full paths instead of folder names, fixed nested folder reorder producing empty sibling lists, and fixed name-vs-path mismatch causing folders to jump to top
- **Fix default sidebar folder ordering** — Folders at every nesting level now sort naturally by default (e.g. Week 1, Week 2, … Week 10) instead of appearing in arbitrary insertion order; custom drag-to-reorder still takes priority when set
- **Fix sidebar folder nesting** — Deeply nested folders (e.g. `University/25-26 Semester 2/COMP208/Week 3`) now display as a proper nested tree instead of flat top-level entries; added `pathsToTree()` utility that splits slash-delimited paths into hierarchical nodes
- **Fix stars disappearing when scrolling past ~50 lines** — Replaced `inset: 0` with `top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%` so the canvas isn't clipped to viewport height; stars now generate dynamically in bands as content grows, so scrolling down always shows stars
- **Fix blank screen after native title bar switch** — Removed duplicate `noteData` destructuring in EditorArea that caused `undefined` prop when the redundant BoojyNotes prop was cleaned up
- **Fix useEffect dependency array** — Replace dynamic property access `noteData[activeNote]?.title` with `noteData` in window title effect dependency array

### Features
- **Separate title bar** — Added a thin 28px draggable title bar above the TopBar with centered window title; traffic lights sit in the title bar row instead of overlapping TopBar content; TopBar left padding reduced since traffic lights no longer occupy that space

### Improvements
- **Compact slash menu** — Single-line rows with smaller icon boxes (24px), reduced padding, and right-aligned monospace shortcut hints instead of verbose descriptions; removed redundant "Text" command; menu is shorter and easier to scan

### Features
- **Spell check** — Native Electron spell check with right-click suggestions, "Add to Dictionary", and language selection (8 languages); toggle on/off in Settings → Appearance; persists across sessions via app settings file
- **Word count tooltip** — Hover over "N words" in the top bar to see character count, character count without spaces, and estimated reading time
- **Find in note (Cmd+F)** — Floating search bar with CSS Custom Highlight API for non-destructive match highlighting; "n of N" counter, previous/next navigation (Enter/Shift+Enter), collapsible Replace section with Replace and Replace All; Escape to close
- **Table alignment** — Column alignment (left/center/right) via toolbar buttons when hovering a table; alignment round-trips through markdown separator row (`:---:`, `---:`, `---`); header row styled with bold + accent tint
- **Table cell formatting** — Bold, italic, code, strikethrough, highlight, and wikilinks now render inside table cells; formatting preserved on blur via `htmlToInlineMarkdown`
- **Table CSV/TSV paste** — Paste tab-separated or comma-separated data into a table cell to auto-fill cells; grid expands if pasted data exceeds current dimensions
- **PDF export** — Export any note as a styled PDF via right-click context menu or File → Export → PDF; renders in a hidden BrowserWindow with print-friendly CSS
- **DOCX export** — Export any note as a Word document via right-click or File → Export → DOCX; supports headings, lists, checkboxes, code, tables (with alignment), callouts, and inline formatting (bold, italic, code, strikethrough, highlight)
- **Import markdown files** — File → Import → Markdown Files to copy `.md`/`.txt` files into the vault; chokidar watcher auto-detects new files
- **Import HTML files** — File → Import → HTML Files converts HTML to markdown via Turndown and saves as `.md` in the vault
- **Import folder** — File → Import → Folder recursively imports all `.md`/`.txt` files preserving directory structure; "Import files here" in folder right-click menu
- **Embed / Transclusion (`![[Note Title]]`)** — Embed another note's content inline as a read-only preview with accent-colored left border; `![[Note#Heading]]` shows only the heading's section; "not found" placeholder with "Create note" button for broken embeds; nested embeds supported up to depth 3; `/embed` slash command; round-trips through markdown
- **Vitest test suite** — 158 tests across 6 test files covering markdown conversion (round-trip for all 14 block types), search (fuzzy matching, indexing, grouping), sidebar tree (sorting, nesting, filtering), backlink index (wikilinks, aliases, dedup), inline formatting (markdown↔HTML, sanitization), and slash command data validation
- **ESLint + Prettier** — Flat ESLint 9 config with React and React Hooks plugins; Prettier auto-formatting for consistent code style; `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` scripts
- **TypeScript (incremental)** — `tsconfig.json` with `allowJs`, `@ts-check` + JSDoc on 5 pure utility files (`sidebarTree.js`, `backlinkIndex.js`, `search.js`, `data.js`, `markdown.js`); shared type definitions in `src/types.d.ts`; `npm run typecheck` script
- **GitHub Actions CI** — Runs lint, format check, type check, tests, and build on push/PR to master and feature branches

### Bug Fixes
- **Lightbox missing ArrowUp/ArrowDown close** — Pressing ArrowUp or ArrowDown now closes the image lightbox, matching Escape and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight behavior
- **Image deselection on typing** — Pressing a printable character while an image block is selected now deselects the image and lets the keystroke pass through to the editor
- **Timestamp filenames for clipboard pastes** — Pasted screenshots now get descriptive filenames like `paste-2026-03-05-143022.png` instead of generic `image.png`
- **Filename deduplication uses dash** — Duplicate filenames now get a `-2` suffix instead of ` 2` (space), avoiding issues with spaces in filenames
- **Friendly filename dots** — Dots in filenames are now converted to spaces in display labels (e.g., `song.final.mix.mp3` → "Song Final Mix")

- **Markdown shortcuts not triggering** — Typing `## `, `- `, `1. `, etc. did not convert to headings, bullets, or numbered lists; the browser inserts trailing spaces as `&nbsp;` entities, and the `htmlToInlineMarkdown` fast path returned the raw entity string without decoding it, so the shortcut regexes never matched; also fixes a latent data corruption bug where `&nbsp;` was stored literally and later displayed as `&amp;nbsp;` after undo/redo or note switching
- **Title text reversal when typing** — Fixed typing "Hello" appearing as "olleH" in the title; the `useLayoutEffect` that syncs external file renames depended on `currentTitle`, causing it to overwrite the contentEditable DOM on every keystroke and reset the cursor to position 0; changed dependency to `syncGeneration.current` (matching the `EditableBlock` pattern) so the DOM is only rewritten on note switch or external file sync
- **Critical: wikilink selection destroying all notes** — Selecting a note from the `[[` autocomplete menu called `commitTextChange(noteId, blockIndex, newText)` with three positional args, but the function expects a single updater function; this set the entire notes state to a string, wiping all data from React state and disk; now uses the correct updater-function pattern matching `updateBlockText`

### Features
- **Wikilink autocomplete menu** — Type `[[` in any block to open an autocomplete menu listing all note titles; fuzzy-filters as you type; Enter or click inserts `[[Title]]` and navigates to the note; "Create note" fallback for non-existent titles; Escape or click-outside to dismiss
- **Callout block rewrite** — Replaced emoji icons with Lucide line icons and native `<select>` with custom type picker dropdown (11 types with icons, colours, checkmark for active); switched from click-to-edit input/textarea to always-live `contentEditable` title and body; keyboard navigation: Enter in title focuses body, ArrowUp/Escape exits, Backspace on empty deletes block, ArrowUp/Down at body edges navigates between blocks
- **Callout alias resolution** — Obsidian aliases (`caution`, `hint`, `error`, `todo`, `faq`, `cite`, `tldr`, etc.) resolve to canonical types on parse while preserving the original alias in `calloutTypeRaw` for round-trip fidelity
- **Callout collapsible syntax** — `+`/`-` fold suffixes (`> [!note]+`) parsed and preserved in round-trip

### Bug Fixes
- **Cursor reversal when typing** — Fixed typing "hello" appearing as "olleh"; the `noteTitleSet` was getting a new object reference on every keystroke (because it depended on `noteData`), causing `EditableBlock` to re-render and rewrite `innerHTML`, destroying cursor position; stabilised the Set reference so it only changes when actual note titles change
- **Callout type picker scroll jump** — Fixed page scrolling to top when opening the type picker; render picker via React portal to `document.body` instead of inside the scroll container; added scroll-save/restore guard via `useLayoutEffect` to prevent residual scroll resets caused by blur→commit→re-render and type-select→re-render paths
- **Consecutive callouts** — Fixed parser consuming the second callout's `> [!type]` line as body text of the first callout
- **Callout search indexing** — Callout title text now included in full-text search index

### Improvements
- **Callout visual tweaks** — Removed colored left border strip, increased background opacity from 6% to 20% for better visibility, aligned body text with icon (removed 31px left padding)
- **Code block — seamless card** — Removed inner box/border from `<pre>` overlay so the code block renders as one clean card
- **Code block — 4-space tabs** — Tab key now inserts 4 spaces (was 2); Shift+Tab removes 4 spaces
- **Code block — trimmed language list** — Removed Rust and Dart from dropdown; kept Plain, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, JSON, Bash, SQL
- **Code block — removed indent guides** — Removed thin vertical indent guide lines for a cleaner look
- **Code block — language label dropdown** — Click the language label (bottom-right) to open a dropdown and change language; hover brightens the label; always shows "Plain" when no language is set
- **Code block — full language names** — Language label now shows "JavaScript", "Python", etc. instead of short codes like "js", "py"
- **Code block — stronger border** — Default border opacity increased from 6% to 10%, focus border from 10% to 18%

### Bug Fixes
- **Code block — blank first line & bracket artifact** — Stripped leading/trailing newlines from code display to fix empty first line and textarea/overlay misalignment; added `display: block` to `<code>` element to prevent anonymous block box rendering issues
- **Code block — overlay double-spacing** — Fixed double line breaks and blank top line in code overlay caused by `\n` between `display:block` spans inside `<pre>`; also removed trailing newline that added extra blank line at bottom
- **Code block — selection artifacts** — Fixed browser default highlight bleeding through textarea by adding `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent` and custom `::selection` style

### Features
- **Code block rewrite** — Replaced header-bar + double-click UX with always-editable textarea + syntax-highlighted overlay; hover-only copy icon (SVG) with green checkmark feedback; bottom-right language label; right-click context menu with "Change Language" submenu (now includes Rust & Dart); Tab/Shift+Tab indent/dedent; Enter with auto-indent; Escape exits to next block; ArrowUp/Down at edges navigates between blocks; Backspace on empty deletes block
- **Link system** — External links render with ↗ icon in soft blue (#6ea8d8), wikilinks in teal (#A4CACE)
- **Single-click to open links** — External links open in browser, wikilinks open note (no modifier key needed)
- **URL hover tooltip** — Shows full URL after 500ms hover delay
- **Right-click context menu on links** — Open, Copy, Edit, Remove actions; broken wikilinks show Create Note option
- **Ctrl/Cmd+K link shortcut** — Insert or edit links via keyboard shortcut with inline popover; also available from floating toolbar
- **Smart paste** — Paste URL over selected text to create `[text](url)` link; paste standalone URL to create clickable link
- **Bare URL auto-detection** — Typed or pasted URLs auto-convert to clickable links with ↗ icon
- **Broken wikilink detection** — Links to non-existent notes rendered with dashed underline in muted color

### Features
- **Obsidian compatibility — code blocks** — Fenced code blocks (` ``` `) now parse, render with Prism.js syntax highlighting, and round-trip perfectly; supports 8 languages (JS, TS, Python, HTML, CSS, JSON, Bash, SQL); double-click or Enter to edit in monospace textarea; language selector dropdown; copy button; `/code` slash command; typing ` ``` ` auto-converts to code block
- **Obsidian compatibility — frontmatter** — YAML frontmatter (`---` at file start) now preserved as a collapsible block showing property count; click to expand and view key-value pairs; round-trips without data loss
- **Obsidian compatibility — callouts/admonitions** — `> [!type]` syntax renders as styled callout blocks with left border, icon, and title; 11 types supported (note, info, tip, warning, danger, success, question, quote, example, bug, abstract); editable title and body; type selector dropdown; `/callout` slash command
- **Obsidian compatibility — tables** — Markdown tables (`| ... |`) render as HTML tables with individually editable cells; Tab/Shift+Tab cell navigation; Enter in last row adds new row; hover toolbar with +Row, +Column, -Row, -Column buttons; `/table` slash command creates default 3x2 table
- **Obsidian compatibility — wikilinks** — `[[Note Title]]` and `[[Target|Display]]` syntax renders as dotted-underline links; Ctrl/Cmd+Click opens the target note or creates it if it doesn't exist; round-trips to markdown without data loss
- **Backlinks panel** — Below each note's content, a "Backlinks" section lists all notes that reference the current note via `[[wikilinks]]`; click to navigate directly to the source note
- **Strikethrough formatting** — `~~text~~` renders as strikethrough; `Cmd+Shift+S` keyboard shortcut; button in floating toolbar
- **Highlight formatting** — `==text==` renders as highlighted text with a subtle yellow background; `Cmd+Shift+H` keyboard shortcut; button in floating toolbar
- **Inline tags** — `#tag` renders in accent color (not confused with `#` headings at line start)
- **Multi-line markdown parser** — Rewritten parser from line-by-line `for` loop to stateful `while` scanner; correctly handles code fences, tables, callouts, and frontmatter spanning multiple lines

### Bug Fixes
- **Live file sync — editor blocks** — External file changes (terminal, Finder, other editors) now update the editor's contentEditable DOM by bumping a shared `syncGeneration` counter, ensuring `EditableBlock` re-syncs its innerHTML
- **Live file sync — title** — Renaming a note's `.md` file externally now updates the title bar; `useLayoutEffect` dependency includes the actual title text instead of only the active note ID
- **Live file sync — new folders** — Creating files in new folders externally now makes both the folder and note appear in the sidebar; `onFileChanged` adds unknown folders to `customFolders`, and `onFileDeleted` re-merges folders after re-read

### Features
- **Full-text fuzzy search** — Sidebar search now searches note titles AND body content with typo tolerance; results grouped by folder with highlighted snippets; keyboard navigation (arrows + Enter) scrolls to and briefly highlights the matching block in the editor; clear button and Escape to dismiss; 150ms debounced for snappy typing; custom fuzzy matching with score-based ranking (no external dependencies)
- **Integrated terminal** — Fully functional multi-instance terminal in the right panel powered by `node-pty` + `xterm.js`; tabbed interface matching the note tab design; spawn real PTY sessions (zsh/bash) with 256-color support; `Cmd+\` toggles panel, `Cmd+Shift+T` creates new terminal, `Cmd+Shift+W` closes active terminal, `Cmd+K` clears, `Cmd+F` searches output; tab context menu with Rename, Clear, Restart, Kill; clickable URLs open in browser; auto-resizes with panel; press Enter to restart exited processes; PTYs cleaned up on app quit
- **Draggable title bar** — Hold non-interactive areas of the top bar to move the window; buttons, tabs, and resize handles remain fully clickable
- **Trash / Recycling Bin** — Deleted notes move to a `.trash/` folder instead of being permanently destroyed; 30-day auto-purge on startup; collapsible Trash section in sidebar with age labels; right-click to Restore or Delete permanently; Empty Trash button; folder deletion moves all contained notes to trash individually; trash persists across restarts via `.boojy-trash-meta.json`
- **Block drag reordering** — Hold any block 400ms to drag and reorder; multi-block drag with text selection; Escape to cancel; auto-scroll near edges; Ctrl+Z reverts the entire drag
- **Sidebar drag reordering** — Hold notes/folders 400ms to reorder or move between folders; drop-into-folder with auto-expand; visual drop indicator line; order persists in `.boojy-meta.json`
- **Image blocks** — Insert images into notes via drag & drop from file explorer, clipboard paste (screenshots via Win+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+4), or `/image` slash command with native file picker; images render inline with hover controls (accent border + delete button); stored as `![alt](.attachments/noteId/file.png)` in markdown for Obsidian/VS Code portability
- **Image storage** — Images saved to `.attachments/{noteId}/` directory inside the vault; `boojy-att:` custom protocol resolves paths efficiently without base64 overhead; attachment directories cleaned up automatically on note deletion
- **Inline formatting** — Bold (`Ctrl+B`), Italic (`Ctrl+I`), and Inline Code (`` Ctrl+` ``) via keyboard shortcuts or floating toolbar; stored as markdown tokens (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``) in block text for full .md file compatibility
- **Floating toolbar** — Notion-style bubble toolbar appears above selected text with Bold, Italic, Code, and Link buttons; shows active format state; disappears on selection collapse
- **Links** — Markdown links `[text](url)` and bare `https://` URLs auto-render as clickable links; Ctrl+Click opens in browser; Link button in toolbar prompts for URL
- **Numbered lists** — Type `1. ` to create a numbered list; auto-numbering across consecutive numbered blocks; Enter continues the list; empty item + Enter converts to paragraph; `/numbered` slash command; persists as `1. text` in .md files
- **Rich paste** — Pasting HTML from web pages preserves bold, italic, and code formatting while stripping all other tags
- **Arrow key navigation between blocks** — ArrowUp/Down now moves the cursor between blocks when at the first/last line of a block (Obsidian-like behavior); ArrowUp from the first block still moves to the title; spacer blocks are skipped
- **Cmd/Ctrl+N** shortcut to create a new note from anywhere
- **Cmd/Ctrl+P** shortcut to open sidebar and focus search input

### Performance
- **Instant terminal startup** — Pre-spawns a warm PTY in the background 2 seconds after app launch; when the user opens a terminal, the already-running shell is claimed instantly instead of waiting 1-3s for `pty.spawn()` + shell init; pool auto-refills after each claim; falls back to normal spawn if no warm PTY is available; warm PTYs cleaned up on app quit

### Improvements
- **Codebase refactor** — Split monolithic `BoojyNotes.jsx` (~3,500 lines) into 17 focused files: 9 custom hooks (`useHistory`, `useNoteNavigation`, `useNoteCrud`, `useBlockOperations`, `useInlineFormatting`, `usePanelResize`, `useBlockDrag`, `useSidebarDrag`, `useEditorHandlers`), 2 utility modules (`domHelpers`, `sidebarTree`), and 5 components (`TopBar`, `Sidebar`, `EditorArea`, `ContextMenu`, `SlashMenu`); main file reduced to ~810 lines as a thin orchestrator
- Word count now strips markdown formatting tokens for accurate counts
- Inline code renders with monospace font, subtle background, and border
- Links render with accent color and subtle underline

### Bug Fixes
- Fix Enter on empty blocks appearing to do nothing — when `beforeText` is empty, `el.innerText = ""` stripped the `<br>` that gives empty blocks visible height, collapsing the old block to 0px; now sets `el.innerHTML = "<br>"` instead, keeping the block visible so the new line appears below
- Add missing app icon (`assets/icon.png`) and fix icon path in `electron/main.js` — the previous `build/icon.png` path was gitignored, so a fresh clone couldn't display the window icon
- Fix `setTabStyleB` crash on Ctrl+, — reference was stale after state rename to `tabFlip`
- Fix Settings crash when `storageLimitMB` is null/undefined — guard `storagePct` calculation and display
- Fix frontmatter parser not stripping surrounding quotes from YAML values
- Fix placeholder text ("Type / for commands...") never showing — `:empty` CSS pseudo-class doesn't match elements containing `<br>`; switched to `.empty-block` class driven by React state
- Fix font size setting not applying to editor — pass `settingsFontSize` through to `EditableBlock`
- Add delete confirmation dialog to prevent accidental note deletion

### Improvements
- Placeholder text ("Type / for commands...") now only appears on the first block of a note, reducing visual clutter on subsequent empty blocks
- Placeholder cursor now appears at the left edge instead of after the text — the hint renders as a faded overlay behind the blinking cursor
- Move brand assets (`boojy-logo.png`, `boojy-notes-text-N.png`, `boojy-notes.text-tes.png`) from repo root into `assets/`; delete unused `boojy-notes-full-name-text-logo.png` and `boojy-notes-settings-circle.png`; update all `<img src>` references
- Archive Flutter platform scaffolding to `flutter-templates` branch and remove local Flutter directories (`android/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `ui/`, `.dart_tool/`, `build/`) from working tree
- Split `boojy-notes-mockup.jsx` monolith (3,344 lines) into focused modules under `src/`: constants (`colors.js`, `data.js`), utils (`colorUtils.js`, `storage.js`, `random.js`), components (`Icons.jsx`, `StarField.jsx`, `EditableBlock.jsx`, `SettingsModal.jsx`), and main component (`BoojyNotes.jsx`); no logic changes

- Set `app.setName("Boojy Notes")` for proper OS display
- Bump version to `0.1.0`; add `electron-builder` config for Windows/macOS/Linux packaging

### Bug Fixes
- Fix editor focus on new blank notes — cursor now appears reliably on first interaction; root cause was `placeCaret` mutating DOM (`<br>` → text node) during focus transitions, which destabilised browser selection state; `placeCaret` is now a pure selection operation (uses element-level `range.setStart(el, 0)` for `<br>` elements), `handleEditorKeyDown` recovers cursor when `rangeCount === 0` instead of silently swallowing keystrokes, removed `suppressEditorFocus` complexity in favour of a `mouseIsDown` ref that lets `handleEditorFocus` defer to `handleEditorMouseUp` during clicks, and added `console.warn` debug logging at all recovery points
- Fix block ID churn in Electron — `useFileSystem` now compares incoming blocks structurally (type, text, checked) and skips state updates when chokidar echoes back files we just wrote, preventing unmount/remount cycles that wiped focus
- Fix double-newline block separation in saved `.md` files — blocks now join with single `\n` (Obsidian-style), and parsing splits on single newlines so each line becomes its own block

### Improvements
- Remove YAML frontmatter from local `.md` files — notes are now clean markdown (Obsidian-style), with title derived from filename and folder from directory structure; note IDs persisted in `.boojy-index.json`

### Features
- **Notes folder chooser in Settings** — desktop (Electron) users can view and change their vault directory from Settings → Sync; default path changed to `~/Documents/Boojy/Notes/`
- **Electron desktop app** — notes stored as real `.md` files on disk (`~/Documents/Boojy/Notes/`), browseable and editable with Obsidian, VS Code, etc.
- Chokidar file watcher detects external edits and syncs them into the app in real-time
- `useFileSystem` hook for filesystem persistence with 500ms debounced writes
- Title/folder renames automatically move files on disk; deletes remove files
- One-time migration: existing localStorage notes written to disk on first Electron launch
- `dev:web` script preserves pure browser development without Electron
- Vault directory configurable via native folder picker

### Bug Fixes
- Fix cursor not appearing after Enter on title or clicking below editor — `mousedown` on the click-below area was defocusing the contentEditable editor before `onClick` could restore it; switched to `onMouseDown` with `preventDefault`; title Enter now explicitly focuses the editor div before placing the caret
- Fix editor body not accepting text input — empty blocks now use `<br>` for caret anchoring so Chromium places the cursor inside the block element
- Fix title→editor caret not appearing on Enter — replaced manual `focus()`/`placeCaret()` with the standard `focusBlockId`/`focusCursorPos` ref pattern to avoid race conditions with React's render cycle
- Fix click-below-editor focus using same ref-based pattern instead of `setTimeout`/`placeCaret`

### Features
- Store notes as portable markdown (`.md`) in R2 instead of JSON — YAML frontmatter for metadata, markdown body for content
- Backward-compatible pull: auto-detects legacy JSON vs new markdown format on sync
- `blocksToMarkdown()` / `markdownToBlocks()` converters for all block types (p, h1–h3, bullet, checkbox, spacer)

### Previous Bug Fixes
- Fix "New Folder" button hidden when no folders exist — button was gated behind `filteredTree.length > 0`
- Fix caret not appearing in Chromium/Electron browsers (Cursor) — ensure empty blocks have a text node for caret anchoring, use `requestAnimationFrame` for title→editor focus transition, and focus existing empty block on click-below
- Fix slash command menu not triggering in Chromium/Electron — strip leading/trailing newlines and trim whitespace before checking for `/`
- Fix Edge Function 401 "invalid JWT" — disable gateway JWT verification (functions verify auth internally)
- Keep settings panel open after OAuth login (Google/Apple redirect no longer closes it)
- Fix Enter key intermittently not creating new blocks in the editor
- Fix slash commands (`/`) not opening the command menu
- **Fix React/contentEditable race conditions** — `cleanOrphanNodes` was running on every render, destroying browser selection state; now only runs after structural ops (Enter/Backspace)
- **Fix focus placement timing** — ref registration and cursor placement now use `useLayoutEffect` (synchronous after DOM update), ensuring refs are ready before focus is placed
- **Fix blockRefs race condition** — parent `useEffect` was clearing all refs AFTER child components registered them
- **Fix duplicate block IDs** — `genBlockId()` now includes timestamp to avoid collisions with existing blocks from localStorage
- Strip trailing newline from `innerText` reads (browser `<br>` artifact)
- Prevent cursor from escaping block structure — guard keydown, input, and click events
- Improved `placeCaret` with `isConnected` check, return value, and fallback recovery
- Snap cursor to nearest block on clicks between or below blocks
- Suppress React `contentEditable` warnings on bullet/checkbox wrapper elements
- Fix sync parse errors for non-JSON remote notes (moved parsing outside React state updater)
- Fix title-to-editor focus transition — `placeCaret` now focuses the contentEditable ancestor before setting selection
- Fix click-below-editor not placing cursor in new block when editor wasn't previously focused

### Improvements
- Auto-select "Untitled" text when creating a new note — typing immediately replaces placeholder title
- Memoize `EditableBlock` with `React.memo` — prevents all blocks from re-rendering on every keystroke
- Stabilize `flipCheck` and `registerBlockRef` with `useCallback` for proper memoization

- Add 7px breathing room above version text and content footer
- Bolder sidebar icons (strokeWidth 1.5 → 2)
- Simplify top bar right section — remove create buttons, keep only panel toggle, word count, and help
- Folder/note sections separated by spacing instead of divider line
- Create buttons hidden during search to avoid clutter
